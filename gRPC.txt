 - gRPC uses Protobufs
    - smaller size
    - compressed
    - Less CPU intensive
    - Binary
    - faster & more efficient communication


- gRPC 
   - relies on HTTP2
   - 
- HTTP1
  - One TCP connection per request
      - 100 images => open & close 100 TCP connections
  - Plaintext headers
      - No compression
  - more latency

- HTTP2
    - One TCP connection shared by multiple requests & responses
    - Server push
      - more data can be pushed without waiting
    - Multiplexing
        - multiple messages can be pushed in parallel over the same connection
    - Headers &  data are compressed
    - SSL connection is required by default
